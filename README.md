# Hi, I’m Deepesh 👋

Senior Product Manager building **AI-powered, data-informed digital products**.  

I’ve spent 6+ years working across **B2B, B2C, D2C and B2B2C** products — from marketplaces to data platforms and internal tools. I love taking messy, ambiguous problems and turning them into **shippable, measurable product bets**.

GitHub is where I:
- 🚀 Prototype ideas before they ever become roadmap items  
- 🤖 Experiment with LLMs, recommendation systems & ML  
- 🛠️ Build utilities that make teams faster and smarter  

---

## What I’m doing on GitHub 💻

This profile is a mix of:

- **Real-world product experiments** – things I’d actually plug into production with some hardening  
- **AI/ML projects** – LLM workflows, recommendation engines, computer vision models, evaluation tooling  
- **POCs & sandboxes** – quick ways to test a hypothesis before asking engineering to invest  

Most repos started from a **genuine product problem** I was trying to solve, not from a tutorial.

## My Experience in Short 🧩

- **Role:** Senior Product Manager  
- **Experience:** 6+ years across marketplaces, SaaS, internal platforms, AI-backed tools  
- **What I’m good at:**
  - Translating vague business asks into **clear product problems & success metrics**  
  - Working at the intersection of **product, engineering, design, data & GTM**  
  - Using **both analytics and user research** (not just dashboards) to make decisions  
  - Shipping **AI/ML-powered features** that are evaluated rigorously and tied to real KPIs  

I care a lot about **product thinking, execution, and leverage** - using AI and automation as force multipliers, not buzzwords.
